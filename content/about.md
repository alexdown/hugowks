This is a tentative of a blog; I have no idea what when and how frequently I'll update this space, but want to give it a try.

Need to learn Jekyll first, so everything is postponed to the next time I'll have a sufficiently long flight or a sufficiently boring layover.

I am [@alexdown](https://github.com/alexdown) on GitHub, [@alxdwn](https://twitter.com/alxdwn) on twitter.

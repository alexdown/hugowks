Clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene should be a normal part of everyone’s daily life. 

Without all three, people can’t live dignified, healthy lives. With all three, they can unlock their potential, break free from poverty and change their lives for good.

With clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene, children are born healthier. They get the chance to go to school and grow up to become adults. Women and men get to earn a living. Whole communities start to thrive. 

It sounds normal and it should be.

[WaterAid](https://www.wateraid.org/) is an international NGO, determined to make clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene normal for everyone, everywhere within a generation. 

## The Challenge

75 amazing professionals from HSBC and KPMG, from twelve+ different countries, hiking for 5 days in the Indian Himalayas, and raising over US$ 65k (and counting!) raised for water sustainability, sanitation, and education.

All funds raised for WaterAid on the [HSBC-KPMG Himalayas Challenge](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6586109353462468608/), will go towards tackling the global water crisis by supporting an HSBC-led project that will enable WaterAid to deliver essential water and sanitation services in apparel supply chains, in Bangladesh and India - improving the living and working conditions of 11,000 people.

Huge thank you to all for your generous contribution, and... fundraising is still open! ;) https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/alessiobasso

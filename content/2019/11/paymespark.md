In early October, a [delegation from PayMe team](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chenpingping_sparkaisummit-payme-activity-6590689219516170240-Y2WD/) went to Amsterdam to attend the [Spark+AI Summit](https://databricks.com/sparkaisummit/europe).

It was a productive week of sharing experiences, meeting practitioners, as well as learn what's coming next in the Spark ecosystem...

We also had a chance to share our experience using data and Databricks to enable a Data Driven Roadmap for our [#paymehk](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23paymehk) products (PayMe and PayMe for Business)...

...some say it's worth 18 minutes of your time... see it for yourself :)

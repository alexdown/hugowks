Last week, Scott Guthrie was in London and gave a ‘private’ presentation about Azure to some teams in the company I work for…

I could not be there in person, but I’m told the below video has pretty much the same content… so I watched it.

If Scott’s goal was to leave you with that crazy urge to try out Azure and build something, he was definitely successful! Great demo and great stuff from Microsoft.

If you don’t have 3+ hours to spare to watch it all, I took some notes (see below).

What‘s the most interesting part, in your opinion?

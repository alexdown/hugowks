Release API & docs -> partner integrates -> profit!!

Intro
- Mutual - you have to solve a problem for them, but they do have to solve a problem for you too e.g. market access (they give you access to a segment you wouldn't otherwise)
  > You don't partner with everyone!

basics
- monitoring (each API from each consumer...)
- throttling (can do?)
but what about
- testing (how to guarantee quality of the consumer implementation?)
- versioning (see previous - sometimes implementation makes a non-breaking change breaking... what to do?)

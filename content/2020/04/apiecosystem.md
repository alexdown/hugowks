Release API & docs -> partner integrates -> profit!!

basics
- monitoring (each API from each consumer...)
- throttling (can do?)
but what about
- testing (how to guarantee quality of the consumer implementation?)
- versioning (see previous - sometimes implementation makes a non-breaking change breaking... what to do?)



**Ashish** has interview 3 ppl for this role already - technically strong, not strong enough in terms of personality to deal with regional stakeholders
Interested of someone from a startup environment, and work with stakeholders *actively*, someone who can say no (governance is 20/25% of architect's role, can say no to things that do not make sense from a ROI perspective)
Looking for a strong leader
- build teams at HSBC, good thing to mention
- startup experience, good to mention
- data - also good to mention. underrepresented on the CV!
he feels this is a very big role, and takes time to see things through. can't be done in a year
--> mention from PayMe example, it takes time to build things. and you understand that!!

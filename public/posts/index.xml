      <title>A Better Octopus Card</title>

      <description>Octopus card is, by all standards, a success story. Introduced in 1997 by a consortium of railway and bus companies, for transit ticketing purposes, it subsequently expanded to other payment usages (restaurants, parking, convenience stores) following Hong Kong Monetary Authority granting Octopus&amp;rsquo; operating company a deposit-taking license.
Pretty much everywhere you go in Hong Kong, you can pay with Octopus. It&amp;rsquo;s as close as one can get to a cashless society utopia.</description>

      <title>Debunking WeChat</title>

      <description>A no-frills description of what WeChat really is.
  I’ve been reading for a while articles about WeChat, a Chinese “mobile instant messaging cum social media” very popular in Mainland China (and not only).
Most of them are a mix and match of:
 screenshots of features provided by either Tencent, Tencent’s partners, or brands’ 3rd party developers, delivered as part of the app, wallet, or embedded web browser description of how WeChat is a “platform” capable of delivering any service imaginable (add again lots of use cases, some really existing some not) usually, an ending highlighting how this is the future of apps and how all western apps should follow Tencent’s footsteps  But really, what is WeChat?</description>

      <title>Cathay Pacific, mobile app</title>

      <description>Few days ago, Cathay Pacific released its new mobile app.
I downloaded the android version, and gave it a try. TL;DR? It&amp;rsquo;s better than it used to be, looks more modern, but there are a number of bugs still open, and questionable design chooices have been made. Here are a few comments.
 Two different loading spinners: why?
  Page transitions (see below an example of the language selection) are ok, but the &amp;ldquo;back&amp;rdquo; button should animate from left to right, not right to left.</description>

      <title>A Website&#39;s restyling</title>

      <description>Last Sunday, Cathay Pacific launched a new restyling for its website. It looks modern while still elegant, and — most important, given the lacking of a mobile app to book flights — it looks good on a mobile.
I write “looks” good, because when you start using it, lots of small issues becomes evident. Let’s start from the beginning.
 When I first open the home page, everything looks good.</description>

      <title>Latency vs. Response time</title>
      <link>http://alexdown.github.io/posts/2014/09/latency/</link>

      <description>I was recently dragged into a call about application performances test, where people were discussing numbers and results trying to explain them in layman&amp;rsquo;s terms.
However, I found that is useful to establish an unambiguous and common vocabulary between all parties involved. Here are some thoughts on the matter.
 Response time - When discussing the response time of the system, people often refers to it as latency. Response time is instead the amount of time a system takes to react to a request once it has received one.</description>

      <title>Coin card, one year later</title>
      <link>http://alexdown.github.io/posts/2014/08/onlycoin/</link>

      <description>One year after my first (and - so far - only) blog post about Coin, the company seems to be in trouble: backers are (rightfully) concerned about the product launch postponed for six months, and commentators ask what are the future plans for the product after its target market - the US - adopt EMV chip cards.
 It seems most of the backers are concerned about the future in regards to the rollout of chip cards in the US, but the FAQ on coin website don&amp;rsquo;t do much to address the concern, insisting it will work during US&amp;rsquo; EMV transition period and if it has a magnetic stripe.</description>

      <title>Credit cards and electronic wallet</title>

      <description>I was watching this video the other day, and wondering about the convenience of the thing. Ideally, yes, it would be nice to have one card to rule them all, and say adios forever to fat wallets full of plastic.
My first though after the foreseeable reaction to the video (that was, &amp;ldquo;COOL!&amp;rdquo;) was if this whole scheme is possible. As:
 the device shown in the video have only a magstripe; most cards nowadays use the chip in many jurisdictions, the rule is still &amp;ldquo;the merchant is not permitted to accept a credit card in the absence of the cardholder and without presentation of the credit card&amp;ldquo;; and this device - at the end - is a copy of a physical card.</description>

      <description>This is a tentative of a blog; I have no idea what when and how frequently I&amp;rsquo;ll update this space, but want to give it a try.
Need to learn Jekyll first, so everything is postponed to the next time I&amp;rsquo;ll have a sufficiently long flight or a sufficiently boring layover.
I am @alexdown on GitHub, @alxdwn on twitter.</description>
